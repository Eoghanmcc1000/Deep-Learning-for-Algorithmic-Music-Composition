# Deep-Learning-for-Algorithmic-Music-Composition
A deep learning project focused on generating melodies with GPT-2 style transformer models, supported by different optimisation strategies.  This project transforms MIDI music files into text sequences, augments the dataset through musical transformations, and trains transformer models to learn and produce musical sequences.
